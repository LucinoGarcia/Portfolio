## [Brain-Controlled Prosthetic Gesture Classification](./BCI-Robot-Arm.html)
- Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying EEG signals to control a UR5e robot arm, achieving a high accuracy of 92%.
- Collected and filtered 1000 EEG samples for four predetermined gestures and a negative classification, initially exploring Decision Trees and other techniques before opting for the CNN due to its effectiveness with spatial data. <br>

## Disease Detection with Computer Vision
- Developed a 3D U-Net model for tumor classification in DICOM format MRI data, utilizing Soft Dice as the loss function and Dice Coefficient as the metric.
- Utilized sensitivity and specificity measures for model evaluation, typically achieving over 85% sensitivity and 90% specificity, showcasing the model's potential for cancerous tissue classification and its ability to generalize well with additional datasets. <br>

## Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

- Employed regression models to predict medical insurance costs and uncover influential factors, selecting Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models due to their versatility in handling various data types.
- The Random Forest model outperformed others, demonstrating the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the highest R-squared value. Smoking, BMI, and age emerged as significant predictors of medical insurance costs. <br>

## Huberman Lab Podcast NLP for Topic Extraction, *In-Progress*
- Aim to develop a topic modeling system employing Natural Language Processing techniques to cluster transcripts sourced from the Huberman Lab Podcast.
- The transcripts for each of the episodes were scraped from [HubermanTranscripts.com](https://www.hubermantranscripts.com/) using Python's Selenium package [by this script](/WebScrape.py). Each of the transcripts was reformatted and saved onto individual .txt files.
