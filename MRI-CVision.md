# MRI Brain Tumor Detection: Project Overview
- Developed a 3D U-Net model for classifying tumors in DICOM format MRI data.
- Data was provided by the Decathlon 10 Challenge but required patching and standardization.
- A 3D U-Net model was chosen for its architecture optimized for volumetric datasets. Soft Dice was used as the loss function, and Dice Coefficient was used as the metric.
- Utilized both sensitivity and specificity as measures of model evaluation. Sensitivity and specificity varied by samples but typically exceeded 85% sensitivity and 90% specificity.
- A 3D U-Net model can definitely be utilized for cancerous tissue classification—even with samples in the hundreds. It should generalize nicely after being trained on additional datasets.



# Resources
**Python Version:** 3.10.9 <br>
**Packages:** NumPy, Matplotlib, JSON, Pandas, Keras backend, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NiBabel, util, public_tests, test_utils



# Data Collection
Data was provided by the [Decathlon 10 Challenge](https://decathlon-10.grand-challenge.org/). 



# EDA
Each of the 484 samples consists of two files. The first file is an image file containing a 4D array of MR images with 3 for voxels and specifying one of the four sequences: Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery, T1-weighted, T1-weighted with gadolinium contrast enhancement, or T2-weighted. The second file is a 3D array label indicating whether the corresponding voxel is background, edema, non-enhancing tumor, or enhancing tumor. The files will have sizes of (240, 240, 155, 4) and (240, 240, 155), respectively. <br><br>
In regards to the voxel, the first two shape components (240, 240) refer to the MRI image along the transversal plane. The third component is the number of slices (155) of those images. Below is mutiple views of a sample. <br><br>

# Data Cleaning
Some rudimentary data cleaning was required, as showcased in [this notebook here.](/MRI_CVision,_Data_Cleaning.ipynb) It essentially boiled down to creating functions for patches and standardization.



# Model Building
<img align="right" src="/images/3D_U-Net_Model_Diagram.png" width="178px">

A 3D U-Net model is utilized for the following reasons:
- Its architecture is specifically designed for volumetric datasets.
- The concatenation of paired-down convolutions and upsampling maintains contextual information.
- It achieves good results with only a couple of hundred samples.


The 3D U-Net model's architecture is quite lengthy, but it, along with all 16,318,307 of its parameters, [can be seen here](/images/3D_U-Net_Model_Diagram.png) or by clicking the image on the right. The scripting to build the model [can be found here](/Need_Power,_MRI_CVision,_Model_Building.ipynb) <br><br>
Unfortunately, limited computing power prohibited local training of the model. Fortunately, a pretrained model was provided. The following table displays its Sensitivity and Specificity:

|                |   Edema           | Non-Enhancing Tumor | Enhancing Tumor |
|:--------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------:|
|  Sensitivity  |       0.8746      |        0.9419        |     0.8049      |
|  Specificity  |        0.97       |        0.9957        |     0.9924      |

# Further Developments
Quite a bit of further work can and will be done on this project. Some of those include:
- Updating the project to ensure compatibility and smoother integration with the latest version of Keras.
- Obtaining access to a more powerful machine and training on the full dataset.
- Training the model on additional MRI datasets to enhance its generalization capabilities.
